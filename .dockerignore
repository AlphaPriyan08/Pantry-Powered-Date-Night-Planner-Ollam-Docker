# .dockerignore

# --- Virtual Environments ---
# These folders contain a copy of the Python interpreter and all installed
# libraries for local development. They can be very large and are irrelevant
# to the container, which builds its own environment from requirements.txt.

# --- Environment Variables ---
# CRITICAL: Never copy your .env file into a Docker image.
# It contains secrets like API keys which would be exposed.

# --- Python Cache & Compiled Files ---
# These are auto-generated files that can bloat the image and cause
# potential conflicts between different OS/Python versions.

# --- IDE / Editor Configuration ---
# Your personal editor settings have no place in the production image.

# --- Streamlit Configuration ---
# This folder stores local user configuration and credentials for Streamlit,
# not needed in the container.

# --- Git ---
# The .git directory contains the entire version history and can be huge.
# It should never be included in the final image. (Note: Modern Docker
# versions often ignore this by default, but it's good practice to be explicit).
.git/

# --- Log files ---
# Application logs should not be part of the image.
