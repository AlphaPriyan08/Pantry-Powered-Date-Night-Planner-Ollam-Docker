## 🕯️ Pantry-Powered Date-Night Planner
An interactive AI agent that transforms your available pantry ingredients into a complete, personalized, and romantic date-night plan. This project demonstrates the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational AI frameworks to create a helpful and engaging user experience. The agent doesn't just give you a recipe; it acts as a "romance concierge," helping you plan the meal, the ambiance, and even a conversation starter, refining its suggestions based on your feedback.

## ✨ Features
- **Conversational Planning:** Tell the agent what ingredients you have, and it will start the planning process.
- **Holistic Experience:** Get suggestions for a main dish, ambiance (music & lighting), decor, and an icebreaker.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The agent asks for your feedback and adjusts the plan until you say it's perfect. Don't like a suggestion? Just say so!
- **Interactive UI:** A simple and clean chat interface with suggested reply buttons to guide the conversation.
- **Memory:** The agent remembers the context of your conversation to provide relevant and personalized refinements.
